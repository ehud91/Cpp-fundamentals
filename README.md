Welcome to the C++ Fundamentals course! This course is designed for beginners and intermediate developers who want to learn the core concepts of C++ programming. The focus of this course is to build a solid understanding of the syntax, functionality, and key principles of the C++ language.
Course Overview

In this course, you will learn the essential concepts of C++ through hands-on coding exercises and real-world examples. By the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of:

* Basic syntax and structure of C++ programs
* Data types and variables in C++
* Control flow statements (if-else, switch, loops)
* Functions and their usage
* Pointers and memory management
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
  * Classes and objects
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
* Standard Template Library (STL): vectors, maps, sets, and algorithms
* File handling in C++
* Best practices for code optimization and error handling

# Getting Started


## Step 1: Install C++ Compiler

Before starting with the exercises, you need to install a C++ compiler on your machine. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

* Windows: Download and install MinGW or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). [Windows installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)
* MacOS: Use the built-in Xcode or install Homebrew and run brew install gcc. [Mac installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac)
* Linux: Install GCC by running sudo apt-get install g++ or equivalent for your Linux distribution. [Linux installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)


## Step 2: Set Up an IDE or Code Editor

You can use any text editor or IDE of your choice. Some popular options are:
* [Visual Studio Code VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


## Step 3: Clone the Course Repository

Clone the course repository to get all the sample codes and exercises:

```bash
https://github.com/ehud91/Cpp-fundamentals.git
cd Cpp-fundamentals-course
```


## Step 4: Compile and Run Your First C++ Program

Exampe1: compile with bash: 
```bash
g++ file_name.cpp -o file_example
./file_example  
```

Examle2, compile with VSCode:
* [VScode - Compile with IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
